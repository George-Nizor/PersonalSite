There is a gap between a clever LLM demo and an AI product that analysts trust. Closing it requires governance, telemetry, and a relentless focus on the UX.

### Governed context first

LangChain excels when the prompt is rich. I lean on Fabric’s Lakehouse to assemble curated parquet slices, then use SQLCell to push the context into embeddings the agent can reason over.

### Human-in-the-loop approvals

Analysts remain the editor-in-chief. Every generated narrative ships with uncertainty metrics, source table references, and a one-click revert to the canonical Power BI view.

### Invisible ops

GitHub Actions keeps the pipelines honest—testing Python transforms, linting DAX, and smoke-testing the conversational flows before they hit production.

With the right guardrails, generative copilots stop being theatre and become an unfair advantage for analytics teams.
