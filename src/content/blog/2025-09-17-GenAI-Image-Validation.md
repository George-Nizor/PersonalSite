# Automating Photo Evidence Review with Generative AI

In many industries, clients often require photos to be evaluated against specific requirements for claims processing. This could include verifying the authenticity of images, checking for certain features, or ensuring compliance with guidelines. Traditionally, this process involves manual review, which is time-consuming and prone to human error. Enter generative AI, particularly large language models (LLMs), which can automate and enhance this validation process.

## The Business Challenge

Imagine a scenario where a client submits photo evidence for an insurance claim, warranty request, or quality assurance check. The photos must meet criteria such as clarity, relevance, and the presence of specific elements (e.g., timestamps, objects, or conditions). Manually sifting through these images can bottleneck operations, especially with high volumes. This is where LLMs step in, offering a scalable solution to analyze and validate images efficiently.

## Leveraging Amazon Bedrock and Claude

Amazon Bedrock provides a managed service for accessing foundation models, including Anthropic's Claude. Claude is particularly adept at multimodal tasks, meaning it can process both text and images. By integrating Claude via Bedrock, I can build a system that ingests photos and evaluates them based on predefined prompts.

To interact with Bedrock, I use Boto3, the AWS SDK for Python. Boto3 simplifies API calls to invoke the Claude model. Here's a high-level overview of how it works:

- **Setup**: Install Boto3 and configure AWS credentials.
- **Invocation**: Use the `bedrock-runtime` client to send image data and prompts to Claude.

For example, I might encode an image as base64 and include it in the API request along with a text prompt describing the validation criteria. Here's a simple code snippet:

```python
import boto3
import base64

bedrock = boto3.client('bedrock-runtime')

with open('image.jpg', 'rb') as image_file:
    image_data = base64.b64encode(image_file.read()).decode('utf-8')

response = bedrock.invoke_model(
    modelId='anthropic.claude-v2',
    body={
        'prompt': 'Evaluate this image for damage evidence.',
        'image': image_data
    }
)
```

## Image Processing with Pillow

Before feeding images to the LLM, preprocessing is often necessary. Pillow (PIL), a Python imaging library, is invaluable here. It allows me to open, manipulate, and convert images. For instance:

- Resize images to optimize for model input limits.
- Convert formats or extract metadata.
- Crop regions of interest.

Pillow ensures that images are in the right format (e.g., JPEG or PNG) and size for efficient processing by Claude. Here's an example of resizing an image:

```python
from PIL import Image

img = Image.open('input.jpg')
img = img.resize((800, 600))
img.save('resized.jpg')
```

## File-System Navigation for Targeted Image Feeding

To handle batches of images, robust file-system navigation is key. Using Python's `os` and `glob` modules, I can traverse directories, filter files by extension, and selectively feed images into the pipeline. This targeted approach avoids unnecessary processing:

- Scan a directory for image files.
- Load each one with Pillow.
- Prepare and send to Bedrock via Boto3.

This setup enables automated workflows, such as processing all images in a claim folder. For example:

```python
import glob
import os

image_files = glob.glob('claims_folder/*.jpg')
for file in image_files:
    # Process with Pillow and send to Bedrock
    print(f'Processing {os.path.basename(file)}')
```

## Prompt Engineering for Better Results

The magic of LLMs lies in prompt engineering. Crafting precise, detailed prompts improves accuracy:

- **Be Specific**: Instead of "Is this photo valid?", I say "Evaluate if this photo shows a damaged vehicle with visible license plate and timestamp, rating clarity on a scale of 1-10."
- **Chain of Thought**: Encourage step-by-step reasoning: "First, identify key elements. Then, check for tampering. Finally, provide a validation score."
- **Examples**: Include few-shot examples in prompts to guide the model.
- **Iteration**: Test and refine prompts based on outputs to minimize hallucinations or biases.

With well-engineered prompts, Claude can provide consistent, reliable evaluations.

## Conclusion

By combining Bedrock's Claude with Boto3, Pillow, and smart file handling, I can automate photo evidence validation, reducing manual effort and improving accuracy. This approach not only speeds up claims processing but also scales with growing data volumes. As generative AI evolves, its role in image validation will only expand, offering even more sophisticated analyses.
