Every analytics leader wants their stakeholders to *feel* the insight. Inside Microsoft Fabric, that starts by treating each semantic model like a narrative arc rather than a warehouse relic.

## Anchor around decisions

Before writing a single DAX measure, I map the real-life inflection points the audience faces. Decision-first modelling keeps the model tight and removes the visual noise that erodes trust.

## Pair telemetry with tone

Numbers alone rarely move the room. I layer qualitative signals—user interviews, product feedback, executive priorities—directly into Power BI via annotation layers. Fabric’s OneLake lets those datasets live side by side.

## Automate the boring bits

Python-powered Fabric notebooks schedule insight refreshes and run LangChain agents that draft commentary the moment pipelines land. Humans still approve the copy, but the assistant removes the blank page fear.

Designing the data story is as critical as the engineering lift. When the narrative sings, adoption follows.
